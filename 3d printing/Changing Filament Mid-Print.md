# Can you change filament mid-print

Yes, you can finish a print with another roll of filament on the **K1 Max 3D printer**, but it requires some manual intervention. The K1 Max does not have an automatic filament runout sensor, so you need to monitor your filament and manually swap rolls when it runs out.

### Steps to Change Filament Mid-Print:

1. **Pause the Print Manually**

    - If you notice the filament running low, you can pause the print using the printer's touchscreen menu.
2. **Unload the Old Filament**
    
    - Go to **Control > Filament > Unload**, and let the printer heat the nozzle and retract the filament.
3. **Load the New Filament**
    
    - Insert the new filament into the extruder and push it until it reaches the hotend.
    - Use **Control > Filament > Load** to ensure the new filament extrudes properly.
4. **Resume the Print**
    
    - Once the new filament is extruding cleanly, resume the print from where it left off.
