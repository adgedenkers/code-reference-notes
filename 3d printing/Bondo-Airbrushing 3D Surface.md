# Using Bondo and Acetone to Airbrush away print lines


Spraying Bondo onto a 3D-printed surface using an airbrush requires thinning it with acetone to create a sprayable consistency. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

### **Materials Needed:**

- **Bondo (Body Filler)** – Standard automotive body filler.
- **Acetone** – Used as a thinner to make Bondo sprayable.
- **Mixing Container** – A disposable cup or jar.
- **Airbrush or Spray Gun** – Preferably a larger nozzle (0.5mm+ recommended).
- **Stir Stick or Mixing Tool** – For thorough blending.
- **Protective Gear** – Gloves, mask (preferably a respirator), and eye protection.
- **3D Printed Object** – Ensure it's clean and dry.
- **Sandpaper** – Various grits (e.g., 220, 400) for smoothing.
- **Primer** – Optional, for a better final finish.

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

#### **1. Prepare the 3D Print**

- Clean the print of any dust, oils, or support material.
- Lightly sand with **220-grit sandpaper** to help adhesion.

#### **2. Mix the Bondo**

- In a disposable cup, **mix Bondo with acetone** at a ratio of **1:1 to 2:1 (Bondo to Acetone)**.
- Stir thoroughly until smooth and thinned to a milk-like or slightly thicker consistency.
- If using **Bondo with hardener**, add a **small** amount of hardener, mix well, and work quickly before it starts curing.

#### **3. Load the Airbrush**

- Pour the thinned mixture into your **airbrush or spray gun**.
- Use a **larger nozzle size (0.5mm or larger)** to avoid clogging.
- If using a smaller nozzle, further thin the mixture with acetone.

#### **4. Spray the Bondo**

- Spray **light, even coats** at a **distance of 6-8 inches**.
- Allow each coat to dry for **5-10 minutes** before applying the next.
- Apply **2-3 coats** for best results.
- If clogging occurs, clean the nozzle frequently with **acetone**.

#### **5. Let It Cure**

- Allow the sprayed Bondo to **fully cure (1-2 hours, ideally overnight)** before sanding.

#### **6. Sand Smooth**

- Start with **220-grit sandpaper**, then move to **400-grit** for a smoother finish.
- Wet sanding can help achieve an ultra-smooth surface.

#### **7. Prime and Finish**

- Apply **primer** before painting to detect any imperfections.
- If needed, repeat the process for additional smoothing.

### **Tips & Precautions:**

- **Work in a well-ventilated area** – Acetone fumes are strong and flammable.
- **Use a respirator** – Protect yourself from inhaling fine particles and fumes.
- **Clean the airbrush immediately** – Acetone can help dissolve Bondo residue.
