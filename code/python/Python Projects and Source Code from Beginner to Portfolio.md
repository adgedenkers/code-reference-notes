**Currency Converter**

This is one of several Python project ideas that require us to install one of the most [popular Python libraries](https://hackr.io/blog/top-python-libraries), which in this case, is the _requests_ module. This is not included with the Python standard library, so use the pip command shown in the source code to install it on your system.

With the _requests_ module, we can make _HTTP_ requests to the Fixer API, allowing us to convert one currency to another. You’ll likely notice that we’re using a 3rd party API, so you’ll need to sign up to get a [free API key](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/fixer-api#pricing). You can then enter your API key into the field shown in the source code, and you’ll be ready to go!

This project allows you to gain some more practice with loops and user input, but it expands on this with HTTP requests to retrieve API data in JSON format.

If you’re unfamiliar with JSON, it’s very similar to a Python dictionary, meaning we can access key-value pairs to fetch the data we’re after. In this case, we are looking for the currency conversion result from the API call.

Look at the docs on the Fixer API site for more details on the different data you can retrieve.

**Source Code:**

```python
'''
Currency Converter
-------------------------------------------------------------
pip install requests
'''


import requests


def convert_currency():
   init_currency = input('Enter an initial currency: ')
   target_currency = input('Enter a target currency: ')

   while True:
       try:
           amount = float(input('Enter the amount: '))

           continue
       else:
           break

   url = ('https://api.apilayer.com/fixer/convert?to='

**Automatic Birthday Mail Sending**

This Python project uses the standard _smtplib_, _EmailMessage,_ and _datetime_ modules, in addition to _pandas_ and _openpyxl_ (these need to be pip installed, as shown below) to send automated birthday emails.

This program reads from an Excel sheet that contains all of your friends’ details (see Excel sheet format in source code below). It then sends them an email if today is their big day before making a note in your spreadsheet to say they’ve received their email.

We’ve used the _smtplib_ and _EmailMessage_ modules to create an SSL connection to our email account and message. We’ve then used a _pandas_ dataframe to store spreadsheet-style data within the Python program (an essential skill for data scientists). Finally, we used date formatting with the _datetime_ module’s _.strftime()_ function.

So, lots of new skills to get to grips with!

**Important note:** See my project on how to [set up Gmail for Python](https://hackr.io/blog/how-to-send-emails-with-python-using-gmail) before tackling this project.

**Language Detector**

This Python project uses the _langdetect_ module (see pip install instructions) to help us identify the language that has been entered. This can be really useful if you’re unsure which language you’re dealing with. 

This is another example where we’ve used _tkinter_ to create a simple GUI involving labels, buttons, and an entry field. We can then collect text from the entry field and process this with the _langdetect_ to determine which language was entered. Finally, we print this result to the GUI to let the user know the result.

Note that the results returned by _langdetect_ are abbreviated language codes. For example, if we enter English text, we will see ‘en’ as the return value.

**Source Code:**

```python
'''
Language Detector
-------------------------------------------------------------
pip install langdetect
'''


from langdetect import detect
import tkinter as tk


def detect_lang():
   window = tk.Tk()
   window.geometry('600x400')
   head = tk.Label(window, text='Language Detector', font=('Calibri 15'))
   head.pack(pady=20)

   def check_language():
       new_text = text.get()
       lang = detect(str(new_text))
       tk.Label(window, text=lang, font=('Calibri 15')).place(x=260, y=200)

   text = tk.StringVar()
   tk.Entry(window, textvariable=text).place(
       x=200, y=80, height=30, width=280)
   tk.Button(window, text='Check Language',
             command=check_language).place(x=285, y=150)
   window.mainloop()

**Text to Speech**

This Python project uses a range of new libraries to convert an existing article into a playable mp3 file. You’ll need to install _nltk_ (natural language toolkit), _newspaper3k,_ and _gtts_ (see pip install instructions).

You’ll see that the program is simple, as we simply pass in a URL for an article to convert, then let the function we’ve defined handle the text-to-speech conversion with our newly installed modules.

So, consider trying this out the next time you fancy turning an article into a playable podcast as it’s definitely one of the cool Python codes to copy!

**Text Editor**

This fun Python project creates a GUI to simulate our very own text editor. This example also uses standard GUI components, including labels, buttons, and entry fields.

However, we’ve also added the ability to open and save files like a real text editor. If you’re new to file handling, this Python project is a great way to understand how to read-in and save files.

Experiment with the code below to solidify your understanding, and see if you can expand on this code to create other features you’re used to using with a text editor, like a ‘find word’ function.

## Python Data Structures & Algorithms

**Binary Search Algorithm**

It’s a rite of passage for all aspiring coders to tackle Binary Search in one of their Python programming projects at some point! I know when I was starting out, some of my most [common Python mistakes](https://hackr.io/blog/common-python-mistakes) involved classic algorithms like this.

This Python project for binary search takes in a _sorted_ list (array), then continually compares a search value with the middle of the array.

Depending on whether the search value is less than or greater than the middle value, the list is split (divide and conquer strategy) to reduce the search space, which hones in on the given search value. This continual division results in logarithmic time complexity.

If you look at the code below, you’ll see that we’ve implemented two solutions: conditional loops and recursion. Both approaches are elegant, so feel free to experiment with each.

If you’re new to recursion, this is a great introduction as it demonstrates how we ‘reduce’ the size of the problem with each recursive call, namely by splitting the list to one side of the current middle element.

We’ve also defined the recursive base case as the point when the middle element equals the search element. In this case, the recursion will stop and return the True value up through the call stack.

If this all sounds alien to you, consider using something like [GitHub Copilot](https://hackr.io/blog/how-to-use-github-copilot) to make more sense of this classic algorithm.

**Source Code:**

```python
'''
Binary Search
-------------------------------------------------------------
'''


def binary_search(a_list, an_item):
   first = 0
   last = len(a_list) - 1

   while first <= last:
       mid_point = (first + last) // 2
       if a_list[mid_point] == an_item:
           return True
       else:
           if an_item < a_list[mid_point]:
               last = mid_point - 1
           else:
               first = mid_point + 1
   return False


def binary_search_rec(a_list, first, last, an_item):
   if len(a_list) == 0:
       return False
   else:
       mid_point = (first + last) // 2
       if a_list[mid_point] == an_item:
           return True
       else:
           if an_item < a_list[mid_point]:
               last = mid_point - 1
               return binary_search_rec(a_list, first, last, an_item)
           else:
               first = mid_point + 1
               return binary_search_rec(a_list, first, last, an_item)


if __name__ == '__main__':
   a_list = [1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 19, 102, 2575, 10000]
  
   print('Binary Search:', binary_search(a_list, 4))
   print('Binary Search Recursive:',
       binary_search_rec(a_list, 0, len(a_list) -1, 4))
```

**Merge Sort Algorithm**

Merge Sort is another popular coding challenge faced by aspiring coders when looking for things to do in Python.

This _divide-and-conquer_ strategy uses division to separate a list of numbers into equal parts, and these are then recursively sorted before being recombined to generate a sorted list.

If you’ve just completed the Binary Search example, you might notice some similarities with division and reducing a problem’s size. You’d be right, which means you’ve likely realized we need to use recursion.

This Python implementation of Merge Sort uses recursion to handle the divide and conquer process. The continual reduction of the problem size allows the problem to be solved when the recursive base case is reached, namely when the problem size is one element or less.

In essence, this Python program continues to recursively divide the list until it reaches the base case. At this point it begins sorting the smaller parts of the problem, resulting in smaller sorted arrays that are recombined to eventually generate a fully sorted array. If you’re familiar with Big O notation, you’ll be curious to know that Merge Sort has a Big O of (n logn).

**Source Code:**

```python
'''
Merge Sort
-------------------------------------------------------------
'''


def merge_sort(a_list):
   print("Dividing ", a_list)
  
   if len(a_list) > 1:
       mid_point = len(a_list)//2
       left_half = a_list[:mid_point]
       right_half = a_list[mid_point:]

       merge_sort(left_half)
       merge_sort(right_half)

       i=0
       j=0
       k=0

       while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
           if left_half[i] <= right_half[j]:
               a_list[k] = left_half[i]
               i += 1
           else:
               a_list[k] = right_half[j]
               j += 1
           k += 1

       while i < len(left_half):
           a_list[k] = left_half[i]
           i += 1
           k += 1

       while j < len(right_half):
           a_list[k] = right_half[j]
           j += 1
           k += 1
  
   print("Merging ", a_list)


if __name__ == '__main__':
   a_list = [45, 7, 85, 24, 60, 25, 38, 63, 1]
   merge_sort(a_list)
   print(a_list)
```

**Queue**

This Python project creates a new class to implement a _Queue_. This is a common data structure in computer science when you need to handle First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scenarios, such as message queues, CPU tasks, etc.

The code is straightforward and offers some more practice with object-oriented programming. Test out the queue to get your head around how it works, and then you’ll be ready to use this data structure in your other projects.

**Source Code:**

```python
'''

-------------------------------------------------------------
'''


class Queue:

   def __init__(self):
       self.items = []

   def __repr__(self):
       return f'Queue object: data={self.items}'

   def is_empty(self):
       return not self.items

   def enqueue(self, item):
       self.items.append(item)

   def dequeue(self):
       return self.items.pop(0)

   def size(self):
       return len(self.items)

   def peek(self):
       return self.items[0]


if __name__ == '__main__':
   q = Queue()
   print(q.is_empty())
   q.enqueue('First')
   q.enqueue('Second')
   print(q)
   print(q.dequeue())
   print(q)
   print(q.size())
   print(q.peek())
```

**Sudoku Solver**

This Python project uses the _pygame_ library (see pip install instructions) to implement a GUI for automatically solving sudoku puzzles. We use several user-defined functions to create the GUI, as shown below.

To solve a sudoku puzzle, this program uses a backtracking algorithm that incrementally checks for solutions, either adopting or abandoning the current solution if it’s not viable.

This step of abandoning a solution is the defining feature of a backtracking approach, as the program _steps back_ to try a new solution until it finds a valid one. This process is incrementally carried out until the entire grid has been correctly filled.

Feel free to experiment with different sudoku problems, and even think about expanding the size of the problem grid (you’ll need a new base image if you do this).

## Python Bot Projects

**Reddit Bot**

This Python project creates an automated Reddit bot with some new modules, namely _praw_ and _enchant_ (see the pip install commands).

This is a fairly simple concept as the program checks every comment in a selected subreddit and then replies to any comments that contain a predefined ‘trigger phrase’. To do this, we use the _praw_ module to interact with Reddit, and _enchant_ to generate similar words to the comment, allowing us to make an appropriate reply.

This idea is really useful if you’re looking for Python projects to learn how to answer questions in your own subreddit. You’d just need to expand this code to include automated responses for predefined questions (you’ve probably already noticed this being used by others on Reddit!). 

**Important note:** You’ll need to check out [these instructions](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps) to get hold of a client_id, client_secret, username, password, and user_agent. You’ll need this information to make comments to Reddit via the API interface.

**Source Code:**

```python
'''
Reddit Reply Bot
-------------------------------------------------------------
pip install praw pyenchant
'''


import praw
import enchant


def reddit_bot(sub, trigger_phrase):
   reddit = praw.Reddit(
       client_id='your_client_id',
       client_secret='your_client_secret',
       username='your_username',
       password='your_pw',
       user_agent='your_user_agent'
   )

   subreddit = reddit.subreddit(sub)
   dict_suggest = enchant.Dict('en_US')

   for comment in subreddit.stream.comments():
       if trigger_phrase in comment.body.lower():
           word = comment.body.replace(trigger_phrase, '')
           reply_text = ''
           similar_words = dict_suggest.suggest(word)
           for similar in similar_words:
               reply_text += (similar + ' ')
           comment.reply(reply_text)


if __name__ == '__main__':
   reddit_bot(sub='Python', trigger_phrase='useful bot')
```

**Chatbot**

This Python project uses the _chatterbot_ module (see pip install instructions below) to train an automated chatbot to answer any question you ask! I know; we’re now using AI!

You’ll see that the program is one of the relatively small Python projects in this list, but feel free to explore the ChatterBot documentation along with the broader field of AI chatbots if you’d like to learn more or expand the code’s features.

If this has whet your appetite for building AI bots, check out our [24-Hour Python Chatbot course](https://hackr.io/blog/24-hour-python-chatbot-course) to learn how to build an AI-powered chatbot with the same tools that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

And if you're hungry for even more AI goodness, check out OpenAI,'s latest feature that lets you [build your own GPT](https://hackr.io/blog/how-to-create-your-own-gpt).

**Important note:** ChatterBot is no longer being actively maintained. This means you need to make a small change to the tagging.py file located in the ‘Lib/site-packages/chatterbot’ directory of your Python installation folder.

Don’t worry; it’s straightforward to do, and we’ve included the exact source code you need to use, as shown below.

**Source Code:**

```python
'''
Chat Bot
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) pip install ChatterBot chatterbot-corpus spacy
2) python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   Or... choose the language you prefer
3) Navigate to your Python3 directory
4) Modify Lib/site-packages/chatterbot/tagging.py
  to properly load 'en_core_web_sm'
'''


from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer


def create_chat_bot():
   chatbot = ChatBot('Chattering Bot')
   trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)
   trainer.train('chatterbot.corpus.english')

   while True:
       try:
           bot_input = chatbot.get_response(input())
           print(bot_input)

       except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError, SystemExit):
           break


if __name__ == '__main__':
   create_chat_bot()
```

**Modify tagging.py:**

Find the first code snippet, which is part of the __init__ method for the PosLemmaTagger class. Replace this with the _if/else_ statement.

**Note:** this example is for the English library we used in our example, but feel free to switch this out to another language if you’d prefer.

```python
# Replace this:
self.nlp = spacy.load(self.language.ISO_639_1.lower())

# With this:
if self.language.ISO_639_1.lower() == 'en':
   self.nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
else:
   self.nlp = spacy.load(self.language.ISO_639_1.lower())
```

## Advanced Python Projects

**Library Management System**

As one of the more advanced Python projects, this program uses object-oriented programming to simulate a library management system.

In this example, we create a Library and Student class, which we can use to create our library system and its users. We’ve then implemented a simple user interface that asks users to select from a range of standard library actions, like borrowing or returning books. 

This is a simple yet powerful example of how you can build out real-world systems via Python and object-oriented programming. Feel free to expand the classes to include other useful features, like unique book IDs, multiple copies of the same book, return dates, fees for returning books late, or any other features you think a library should have!

**Source Code:**

```python
'''
Library
-------------------------------------------------------------
'''


class Library:

   def __init__(self, books):
       self.books = books

   def show_avail_books(self):
       print('Our Library Can Offer You The Following Books:')
       print('================================================')
       for book, borrower in self.books.items():
           if borrower == 'Free':
               print(book)

   def lend_book(self, requested_book, name):

           self.books[requested_book] = name

               f' on loan to: {self.books[requested_book]}')
           return False

   def return_book(self, returned_book):
       self.books[returned_book] = 'Free'
       print(f'Thanks for returning {returned_book}')


class Student:
   def __init__(self, name, library):
       self.name = name
       self.books = []
       self.library = library

   def view_borrowed(self):
       if not self.books:
           print('You haven\'t borrowed any books')
       else:
           for book in self.books:
               print(book)

   def request_book(self):
       book = input(
           'Enter the name of the book you\'d like to borrow >> ')
       if self.library.lend_book(book, self.name):
           self.books.append(book)

   def return_book(self):
       book = input(

       if book in self.books:
           self.library.return_book(book)
       else:
           print('You haven\'t borrowed that book, try another...')


def create_lib():

**Netflix Recommendation System**

To cap it all off, we’ve saved a particularly exciting Python project for last! This is a Netflix recommendation system, ideal for aspiring data scientists. In fact, if you’re considering a [machine learning course](https://hackr.io/blog/machine-learning-courses), this is a great project to reinforce your new skills.

To create this project, you’ll need to import a range of modules, including _tkinter, re, nltk, pandas, and numpy_ (see pip install instructions for new modules). You’ll also need to download a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satpreetmakhija/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows-2021?resource=download) containing Netflix movies and TV shows. 

We’ll use _tkinter_ to create our GUI, which will use labels, buttons, and entry fields. The user will then be able to enter a TV show or movie they enjoyed on Netflix to return recommendations based on their taste. 

The recommendation engine uses cast, director, ratings, country, and genres as machine learning (ML) ‘features’. The code then uses the ‘cosine similarity’ approach to find similar results based on user input. This extensively uses _pandas_ and _numpy_ to clean the data and prepare it for processing.

There is a lot to unpack in this example, as it uses lots of [Python concepts for data science](https://hackr.io/blog/python-concepts-data-science).

The best approach is to slowly work through the code and then carry out further research on Machine Learning (ML), ‘features’, and ‘cosine similarity’. 

You’ll then be able to understand how to use a dataset to derive recommendations based on similarities. If you’re an aspiring data scientist, this is a terrific project to get your feet wet!

## Where To Start With Python

Today, we’re experiencing an ever-growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data science across the vast majority of business sectors. One of the main things these fields have in common is that they use the [Python programming language](https://hackr.io/blog/python-programming-language) in one way or another.

When it comes to learning Python in 2025, you have so many choices. Plus, if you'd prefer an in-depth and interactive learning experience, we’d also recommend our [new Python course](https://hackr.io/blog/python-course). 

## What Should I Build Using Python?

This is a great question, especially if you’re brand new to coding in Python.

Well, first things first, you should know that there are so many [Python applications](https://hackr.io/blog/python-applications) in various disciplines, so you have lots of options.

Of course, Python has developed a solid reputation for data science, data analysis, machine learning, and AI, but it doesn’t end there.

It’s also really good when it comes to web development, thanks to popular web application frameworks like [Django and Flask](https://hackr.io/blog/flask-vs-django).

Equally, it’s also ideal for automating repetitive tasks, hence its origin as a scripting language.

To put it simply, you can build a lot with Python, but if you’re looking for inspiration, you’re in the right place!

That's why I put together these Python projects for you to get stuck into.

## Wrapping Up

Building projects is the fastest way to learn—and now you have a list of **real-world, portfolio-worthy ideas** to work on.

Pick a project, start coding, and watch your Python skills grow. And remember, I’m always adding new projects, so **bookmark this page and check back for more!**

Happy coding!
